# Kaggle-Competition---Rental-Listing-Inquiries
https://www.kaggle.com/c/w21projii/data

This is my second inclass project for statistical inference class, designed for undergraduate/master students (stat 457/857).

I'm predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content like number of bedrooms, price, features etc.

Provide a brief introduction of the goal of this task. I'm first get to know the data, include some graphical displays, and comment on patterns/characteristics of the data you find interesting or relevant to your later analysis.
The emphasis of the project is on getting better classification rules, and I will describe your effort on how to achieve this goal. For example, I'm discuss how you create meaningful features, how to select tuning parameters for your algorithms, and how to combine different algorithms etc.
I'm building at least three classification models. Options include logistic regression, random forests, boosting, and any other reasonable methods. Please note that these methods have to be different in nature. For example, the same algorithm with two different parameter configurations is counted as one. You will include a description of the methodology, as well as the implementation if it is not trivial.

In this project, I include:
A brief introduction
Exploratory data analysis
Descriptions and discussions on at least three prediction models
My prediction scores on Kaggle
